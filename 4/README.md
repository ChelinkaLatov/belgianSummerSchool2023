#Solution
You need to run stegsolve.jar. To do this, use the command "java -jar stegsolve.jar".
A window will pop on your screen and you need to go to "File --> Open" and select your bmp file.
Now, you may click on the arrows to go left and right. The setting "Random Colour map" will give you the flag.

How it doesn't show when working with weak bytes i dunno ??? Might investigate later.
